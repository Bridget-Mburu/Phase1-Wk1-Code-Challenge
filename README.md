# Phase1-Wk1-Code-Challenge

 ## Description
 In this document javascript is used to write down solutions of the challenges given. 

## Installation 
To set up the programs to run, step by step follow the steps below;

 ## Prerequisites
 - JavaScript node
 - Git(for cloning the repository)
 
 ## Steps 
 First clone the repository
  
  git clone //git@github.com:Bridget-Mburu/Phase1-Wk1-Code-Challenge.git
  cd Phase1-Wk1-Code-Challenge


## Instructions
*Code Challenge 1 - Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade.

*Code Challenge 2 - Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input . If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

*Code Challenge 3 - Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the PAYE, NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

## Challenge 1 : Grade Student Generator
The first challenge which is to create a Grade Generator from a range of 0 to 100.This is used by students to get their grades score.

## Usage
To operate the grade generator 
 1. First start the file

 2.`if...else if...else` condition is used to write the function.
 Run to viw the grade update, the mark input corresponds the correct output grade.

 3. Prompt is used hence when running to view the code `Enter marks` pops up where one inputs the marks.

## Challenge 2 : Speed Detector
The speed detector is used to detect the speed of every single car and determines if it is fit to be on the road by the authorities. The prefered speed is less or equal to 70km/s.

## Usage 
1.Open the file 

2. `Enter the speed of the car` in the 'let carSpeed'
Every car which exceeds 70 the demerit points are calculated which is 1 is equal to 5km/s .When the licence of the car passes more than 12 demerits it is suspended hence use of `if..else` statement to determine whether the car is `Ok` or `Licence Suspended`.

## Challenge 3 : Net Salary Calculator
This is a Net Salary Calculator which calculates an individual net salary after the benefits and deductions annually. 

## Usage
1.Start the file 

2.`Enter the values`.The basic Salary and Benefits.
Gross Salary is the salary before deductions and it is given by use of `if...else` for it must meet some required conditions.

`if...else if...else` statement is used to find  the PAYE which is the taxed on the anual gross Salary. The same condition is used to get the NHIF Deductions immediately after and the NSSF Deductions are calculated in the program.
 Lastly view the Individual's Net Salary which is displayed together with the values calculated before in the program.
